[00:13.22] White, silicon eyes
[00:16.50] Watching storms, sitting quiet
[00:19.64] Reading books in the heat of city lights
[00:39.64] 
[00:26.62] Bored, everyone's bored
[00:29.67] When I'm restless, put me under the night life stars
[00:35.19] And I will feel grounded
[00:47.19] 
[00:39.80] I know I'm just a girl, but can I change lives?
[00:45.61] If I am nothing, if I am trying
[00:48.92] I think I can
[00:55.42] 
[00:52.62] I step on broken glass
[00:55.10] And dream of soft clouds
[00:58.89] When feelings are heavy, they become all we are
[01:22.39] 
[01:05.96] And we become night-time dreamers
[01:08.46] And street walkers, and small talkers
[01:11.74] When we should be daydreamers
[01:15.41] And moonwalkers, and dream talkers
[01:32.41] 
[01:18.67] And we become night-time dreamers
[01:21.71] And street walkers, and small talkers
[01:24.92] When we should be daydreamers
[01:28.54] And moonwalkers, and dream talkers
[01:31.64] In real life
[01:37.64] 
[01:35.01] The quiet lust, belongs to all of us
[01:38.15] And drives us closer, into the madness of the world
[01:43.08] Of a gun
[01:45.63] (And it suits me just fine)
[01:59.13] 
[01:48.66] 'Cause everyone lies
[01:50.85] And nobody loves
[01:52.39] And somebody dies right now
[01:54.82] I hear the quiet
[01:56.46] Sweet music that no one sings
[02:10.96] 
[02:01.07] And we become night-time dreamers
[02:04.45] And street walkers, and small talkers
[02:07.66] When we should be daydreamers
[02:11.11] And moonwalkers, and dream talkers
[02:28.11] 
[02:14.48] And we become night-time dreamers
[02:17.63] And street walkers, and small talkers
[02:21.00] When we should be daydreamers
[02:24.17] And moonwalkers, and dream talkers
[02:27.26] In real life
[02:33.26] 
[02:29.93] All I ever know is what I dream about when I am sober
[02:34.70] Never turn away from love before the love you have is over
[02:41.95] (Nothing can die)
[02:43.42] All I ever know is what I dream about when I am sober
[02:47.57] (Nothing can die)
[02:49.11] Never turn away from love before the love you have is over
[03:18.11] 
[02:54.56] Nothing can die while we are here
[02:57.78] Nothing can die while we are here
[03:01.09] Nothing can die while we are here
[03:04.67] Nothing can die while we are here
[03:21.17] 
[03:06.80] So, we become
[03:08.43] (Nothing can die while we are here)
[03:09.51] Night-time dreamers
[03:11.11] And street walkers
[03:12.58] (Nothing can die while we are here)
[03:13.60] And small talkers
[03:22.10] 
[03:14.65] When we should be
[03:16.45] (Nothing can die while we are here)
[03:17.65] Daydreamers
[03:18.65] And moonwalkers
[03:19.58] (Nothing can die while we are here)
[03:20.32] And dream talkers
[03:28.82] 
[03:21.02] And we become
[03:21.93] (Nothing can die while we are here)
[03:22.88] Night-time dreamers
[03:24.13] And street walkers
[03:25.70] (Nothing can die while we are here)
[03:26.62] And small talkers
[03:35.12] 
[03:27.73] When we should be
[03:28.88] (Nothing can die while we are here)
[03:29.97] Daydreamers
[03:30.65] When we should be
[03:31.49] (Nothing can die)
[03:32.13] (Nothing can die)
[03:33.07] (Nothing can die)
[03:33.76] Daydreamers
