White, silicon eyes,
watching storms, sitting quiet
Reading books
in the heat of city lights
Bored, everyone's bored
When I’m restless, put me under
the night life stars
And I will feel grounded
I know I'm just a girl,
but can I change lives?
If I am nothing, if I am trying,
I think I can
I step on broken glass,
and dream of soft clouds
When feelings are heavy they
become all we are
And we become
night time dreamers
And street walkers,
small talkers
When we should be daydreamers
And moonwalkers
and dream talkers
And we become
night time dreamers
Street walkers, small talkers
When we should be daydreamers
And moonwalkers
and dream talkers
In real life
The quiet lust
belongs to all of us
And drives us closer
into the madness of the world,
of a girl
(And it suits me just fine)
'Cause everyone dies,
and nobody loves
And somebody dies right now
I hear the quiet,
sweet music that no one sings
And we become
night time dreamers
Street walkers and small talkers
When we should be daydreamers
And moonwalkers
and dream talkers
And we become
night time dreamers
Street walkers, small talkers
When we should be daydreamers
And moonwalkers
and dream talkers
In real life
All I ever know is what I
dream about when I’m sober
Never turn away from love
before the love you have is over
(Nothing can die)
All I ever know is what I
dream about when I'm sober
(Nothing can die)
Never turn away from love
before the love you have is over
Nothing can die
while we are here
Nothing can die
while we are here
Nothing can die
while we are here
Nothing can die
while we are here
Then we become
night time dreamers
Street walkers and small talkers
When we should be daydreamers
And moonwalkers
and dream talkers
And we become
night time dreamers
Street walkers, small talkers
And you should be
Daydreamer
Daydreamer
Daydreamer
